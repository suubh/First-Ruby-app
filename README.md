- Make sure Ruby is installed on your system. Fire command prompt and run command:<br>
      -> `ruby -v` Make sure Rails is installed.<br>
      -> `rails -v` If you see Ruby and Rails version then you are good to start. 
  
- Fork this repo and clone it.

- Install all dependencies .<br>
      -> `bundle install` 
      
- Create db and migrate db.<br>
      -> `rake db:create`<br>
      -> `rake db:migrate`
      
- Now run your application .<br>
      -> `bin/rails server` or `sudo bin/rails server` or `rails s`
